/// A convenience class for binding Reducers to Actions of a given Type. This
/// allows for type safe [Reducer]s and reduces boilerplate.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// In order to see what this utility function does, let's take a look at a
/// regular example of using reducers based on the Type of an action.
///
/// ```
/// // We define out State and Action classes.
/// class AppState {
///   final List<Item> items;
///
///   AppState(this.items);
/// }
///
/// class LoadItemsAction {}
/// class UpdateItemsAction {}
/// class AddItemAction{}
/// class RemoveItemAction {}
/// class ShuffleItemsAction {}
/// class ReverseItemsAction {}
/// class ItemsLoadedAction<Item> {
///   final List<Item> items;
///
///   ItemsLoadedAction(this.items);
/// }
///
/// // Then we define our reducer. Since we handle different actions in our
/// // reducer, we need to determine what kind of action we're working with
/// // using if statements, and then run some computation in response.
/// //
/// // This isn't a big deal if we have relatively few cases to handle, but your
/// // reducer function can quickly grow large and take on too many
/// // responsibilities as demonstrated here with pseudo-code.
/// final appReducer = (AppState state, action) {
///   if (action is ItemsLoadedAction) {
///     return new AppState(action.items);
///   } else if (action is UpdateItemsAction) {
///     return ...;
///   } else if (action is AddItemAction) {
///     return ...;
///   } else if (action is RemoveItemAction) {
///     return ...;
///   } else if (action is ShuffleItemsAction) {
///     return ...;
///   } else if (action is ReverseItemsAction) {
///     return ...;
///   } else {
///     return state;
///   }
/// };
/// ```
///
/// What would be nice would be to break our big reducer up into smaller
/// reducers. It would also be nice to bind specific Types of Actions to
/// specific reducers so we can ensure type safety for our reducers while
/// avoiding large trees of `if` statements.
///
/// ```
/// // First, we'll break out all of our individual State Changes into
/// // individual reducers. These can be easily tested or composed!
/// final loadItemsReducer = (AppState state, LoadTodosAction action) =>
///   return new AppState(action.items);
///
/// final updateItemsReducer = (AppState state, UpdateItemsAction action) =>
///   return ...;
///
/// final addItemReducer = (AppState state, AddItemAction action) =>
///   return ...;
///
/// final removeItemReducer = (AppState state, RemoveItemAction action) =>
///   return ...;
///
/// final shuffleItemsReducer = (AppState state, ShuffleItemAction action) =>
///   return ...;
///
/// final reverseItemsReducer = (AppState state, ReverseItemAction action) =>
///   return ...;
///
/// // We will then wire up specific types of actions to our reducer functions
/// // above. This will return a new Reducer<AppState> which puts everything
/// // together!.
/// final Reducer<AppState> appReducer = combineReducers([
///   new TypedReducer<AppState, LoadTodosAction>(loadItemsReducer),
///   new TypedReducer<AppState, UpdateItemsAction>(updateItemsReducer),
///   new TypedReducer<AppState, AddItemAction>(addItemReducer),
///   new TypedReducer<AppState, RemoveItemAction>(removeItemReducer),
///   new TypedReducer<AppState, ShuffleItemAction>(shuffleItemsReducer),
///   new TypedReducer<AppState, ReverseItemAction>(reverseItemsReducer),
/// ]);
/// ```

/// A convenience type for binding a piece of Middleware to an Action
/// of a specific type. Allows for Type Safe Middleware and reduces boilerplate.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// In order to see what this utility function does, let's take a look at a
/// regular example of running Middleware based on the Type of an action.
///
/// ```
/// class AppState {
///   final List<Item> items;
///
///   AppState(this.items);
/// }
/// class LoadItemsAction {}
/// class UpdateItemsAction {}
/// class AddItemAction{}
/// class RemoveItemAction {}
/// class ShuffleItemsAction {}
/// class ReverseItemsAction {}
/// class ItemsLoadedAction<Item> {
///   final List<Item> items;
///
///   ItemsLoadedAction(this.items);
/// }
///
/// final loadItems = () { /* Function that loads a Future<List<Item>> */}
/// final saveItems = (List<Item> items) { /* Function that persists items */}
///
/// final middleware = (Store<AppState> store, action, NextDispatcher next) {
///   if (action is LoadItemsAction) {
///     loadItems()
///       .then((items) => store.dispatch(new ItemsLoaded(items))
///       .catchError((_) => store.dispatch(new ItemsNotLoaded());
///
///     next(action);
///   } else if (action is UpdateItemsAction ||
///       action is AddItemAction ||
///       action is RemoveItemAction ||
///       action is ShuffleItemsAction ||
///       action is ReverseItemsAction) {
///     next(action);
///
///     saveItems(store.state.items);
///   } else {
///     next(action);
///   }
/// };
/// ```
///
/// This works fine if you have one or two actions to handle, but you might
/// notice it's getting a bit messy already. Let's see how this lib helps clean
/// it up.
///
/// ```
/// // First, let's start by breaking up our functionality into two middleware
/// // functions.
/// //
/// // The loadItemsMiddleware will only handle the `LoadItemsAction`s that
/// // are dispatched, so we can annotate the Type of action.
/// final loadItemsMiddleware = (
///   Store<AppState> store,
///   LoadItemsAction action,
///   NextDispatcher next,
/// ) {
///   loadItems()
///     .then((items) => store.dispatch(new ItemsLoaded(items))
///     .catchError((_) => store.dispatch(new ItemsNotLoaded());
///
///   next(action);
/// }
///
/// // The saveItemsMiddleware handles all actions that change the Items, but
/// // does not depend on the payload of the action. Therefore, `action` will
/// // remain dynamic.
/// final saveItemsMiddleware = (
///   Store<AppState> store,
///   dynamic action,
///   NextDispatcher next,
/// ) {
///   next(action);
///
///   saveItems(store.state.items);
/// }
///
/// // We will then wire up specific types of actions to a List of Middleware
/// // that handle those actions.
/// final List<Middleware<AppState>> middleware = [
///   new TypedMiddleware<AppState, LoadTodosAction>(loadItemsMiddleware),
///   new TypedMiddleware<AppState, AddTodoAction>(saveItemsMiddleware),
///   new TypedMiddleware<AppState, ClearCompletedAction>(saveItemsMiddleware),
///   new TypedMiddleware<AppState, ToggleAllAction>(saveItemsMiddleware),
///   new TypedMiddleware<AppState, UpdateTodoAction>(saveItemsMiddleware),
///   new TypedMiddleware<AppState, TodosLoadedAction>(saveItemsMiddleware),
/// ];
/// ```

/// ### Example

///     friendReducer(state, action) {
///       return state + " friend";

/// Defines a utility function that combines several typed reducers.
///
/// This is a thin wrapper around [combineReducers] that is useful when Dart 2
/// cannot infer the proper types. This can arise in situations such as the
/// following:
///
///     combineReducers(new List()
///       ..addAll(Screen1Redux.contributeReducers())
///       ..addAll(Screen2Redux.contributeReducers()));
///
///     class Screen1Redux {

///     }
///
///     class Screen2Redux {
///       static List<TypedReducer<String, dynamic>> contributeReducers() => ...
///     }
///
/// In these types of cases, Dart 2 would give the following error:
///
///     Error: A value of type 'dart.core::List<#libnull::TypedReducer<dart.core::String, dynamic>>' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'dart.core::Iterable<(dart.core::String, dynamic) â†’ dart.core::String>'.
